# Craps
 The Die Experience Programming Exercise

Hi there..

I developed this on visual studio 19 IDE using C# .Net framework 4.7.2

You can download the executable file from Craps\bin\Debug\Craps!

When user clicks the roll button the program will genarate two random numbers within 1-6 as the dice do.

No number will get three times in 10 rolling rounds.

I used a circular array to keep the last 10 numbers.

From the interface you will be able to see the last 10 numbers. So that it will be easy to test.

Thank you.
